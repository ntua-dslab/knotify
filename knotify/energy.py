    # with larger loop sizes, which allows for more hairpin/bulge options.

    # operation. However, we have seen dot brackets with few stems that give
    # very good energy results (and are part of the ground truth, because of
    # bulges and/or hairpins in the pseudoknot loops). For an example, see case
